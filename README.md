# Music-Genre-Transfer-with-Deep-Learning

This project follows sumu's Cyclegan project https://github.com/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer

Two extra methods are introduced: Spectral Normalization and Self-Attention GANs. Their effects are tested.

an alternative genre classifier can also be used, which is a multi-type classifier that directly classify the three genres instead of a binary classification.

the directory 'notebook' contains files that generate the training data: just run 'generate_npy_from_midi.ipynb'. Other file are used to do some data statistics.
